For the first task of adding categories to favoritesData.json file, I added two other keys called “Foods” and “Games”, and their values follow a similar format to the given category of “Books”.

For the second task, I created a new .json file (newDataset.json) inside the mockData folder and added a few sample data. For its route handling, I created a new .js file (newData.js) inside the routes folder. I followed a similar pattern to favorites.js file to make things easier to follow. Finally, I added the new route in the app.js file.

For the last task, I tried to load the data from the local .json file into a variable, converted that object variable into an array, and then sorted the array using the customfunction (The customfunction compares the category of each data and sorts them based on their Unicode value).
